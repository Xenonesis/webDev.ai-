# Fix for "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'future')" Error

## Problem
The error was occurring in the Vercel deployment where the application would fail to start with:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'future')
```

This was happening because:
1. The client-side code was trying to access `window.__remixContext.future` but `window.__remixContext` was undefined in the Vercel SPA deployment
2. The server-side rendering wasn't properly injecting the Remix context into the HTML

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced entry.client.tsx
- Added proper error handling and fallbacks for when `window.__remixContext` is undefined
- Created a `getRemixContext()` function that safely accesses and initializes the Remix context with default values
- Added comprehensive error boundaries to prevent crashes
- Implemented proper hydration logic that works in both SSR and SPA modes

### 2. Fixed entry.server.tsx
- Modified the server-side rendering to properly inject `window.__remixContext` into the HTML
- Serialized the Remix context and injected it as a script tag in the head of the HTML
- Ensured the context is properly escaped to prevent XSS vulnerabilities

### 3. Consistent Remix Configuration
- Made sure both vite.config.ts and vite.config.vercel.ts have consistent Remix plugin configurations
- Explicitly defined the `remixConfig` object to ensure it's properly passed to the plugin

## Key Changes

1. **entry.client.tsx**: Added robust error handling and context initialization
2. **entry.server.tsx**: Properly inject Remix context into the HTML for client-side access
3. **vite.config.ts**: Ensured consistent Remix configuration
4. **vite.config.vercel.ts**: Ensured consistent Remix configuration

## Testing
The build completes successfully and the generated index.html properly references the entry.client file.

These changes should permanently fix the Vercel deployment issue by ensuring that:
1. The Remix context is always available in the browser
2. Proper fallbacks are in place when the context is missing
3. Error handling prevents crashes during initialization
